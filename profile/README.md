# 🐦 Koonj Inc

**Koonj Inc** is the company behind **Koonj App** — a social‑adventure mobile platform that blends community, exploration, and story‑driven games into a calm, human‑first experience.
Our goal is simple: **make people feel at home**, connected, and curious — without the noise of artificial hype or empty gamification.

## 🌱 Philosophy

Koonj is built around three core ideas:

* **Human first, not algorithm first** – real people, real conversations
* **Slow engagement** – explore, read, solve, reflect
* **Cultural warmth** – inspired by Iranian / Persian feelings of community, place, and storytelling

No endless scrolling. No aggressive AI bubble. Just meaningful interaction.
